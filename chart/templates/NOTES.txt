dNation Ping has been installed.
Check its status by running:
    kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods

If you need to access one of the pods from outside of the cluster, you need to expose pod's service
with $ kubectl port-forward --address (address to listen on, default is localhost) svc/(svc-name) (port):80
For example to expose grafana: $ kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/dnation-ping-grafana 3000:80
